# White Album Restoration Patch 0.1
Delocalizes some content in White Album (2023 PC version), namely:

- Restoring honorifics (-kun, -san, etc.) along with first/last names used
- Removing Miss, Mr., etc.
- Replacing "Older Lady" with "Senpai"
- Replacing "doll" with Rina-chan

Please support the developers and purchase the game! This project, like the original, was created out of a love for it. We're super fortunate to have gotten an official re-release, and this projects aims to just make tiny adjustments to the script that are ever so slightly more faithful to the original text out of sheer personal preference.

**Note:** This patch is largely untested and was created mostly automatically. Use at your own discretion!

## How to apply
- Download the [xdelta file](wa_honorifics.xdelta) and apply to your **Data/Game/ENG/Script.sdat** file using Delta Patcher. For example, `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\WHITE ALBUM\Data\Game\ENG\Script.sdat`
