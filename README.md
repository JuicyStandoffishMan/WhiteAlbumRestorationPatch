# White Album Restoration Patch
Delocalizes some content in White Album (2023 PC version), namely:

- Restoring honorifics (-kun, -san, etc.)

Hopefully that's all that needs to be delocalized!

## How to apply
- Download the [xdelta file](wa_honorifics.xdelta) and apply to your **Data/Game/ENG/Script.sdat** file using Delta Patcher. For example, `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\WHITE ALBUM\Data\Game\ENG\Script.sdat`
